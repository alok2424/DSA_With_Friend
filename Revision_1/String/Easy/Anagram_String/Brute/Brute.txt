1)First, check if the lengths of both strings are equal. If not, they can't be anagrams and return false immediately.
2) Convert strings to char arrays 
3)If the lengths match, sort both strings using a built-in sorting algorithm.
4)Once sorted, iterate through each character of both strings and compare them one by one.
5)If any character mismatch is found, return false.
6)If all characters match, return true, confirming that the strings are anagrams.
