1)First, check if the lengths of both strings are equal. If not, return false immediately as they cannot be anagrams.
2)Initialize a frequency array of size 26 (for all uppercase English letters) and set all elements to 0.
3)Traverse the first string and increment the frequency of each character.
4)Traverse the second string and decrement the frequency of each character.
5)Finally, check if all elements in the frequency array are zero. If any element is not zero, return false as the characters do not match in frequency.
6)If all frequencies are zero, the strings are anagrams and the function returns true.
