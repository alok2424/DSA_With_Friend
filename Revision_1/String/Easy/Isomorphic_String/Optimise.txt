1)Think of isomorphism as a consistent one-to-one mapping between characters of two strings.
2)The goal is to ensure the pattern of appearances and repetitions is identical in both strings.
3)Use two fixed-size arrays (size 256) to track the last-seen positions of characters from each string.
4)While scanning both strings together, compare if the characters at the current position have been seen at the same relative positions before.
5)If not, it indicates inconsistent mapping — one character maps to multiple others — return false.
6)If consistent, update the last seen position of both characters to ensure future checks remain valid.
7)This approach confirms isomorphic structure by comparing character occurrence patterns, not the characters themselves.
