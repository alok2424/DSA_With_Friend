1)Understand that Roman numerals are generally written in descending order of value, and their values are added.
2)However, when a smaller value appears before a larger one, it indicates subtraction instead of addition.
3)To handle this, scan the string from left to right and compare each character with the one after it.
4)If the current symbol is smaller than the next, treat it as a subtractive pair.
5)Otherwise, treat the symbol as a standalone value and add it normally.
6)The final character is always added since there's nothing after it to compare.
7)TC: O(N) && SC: O(1)
