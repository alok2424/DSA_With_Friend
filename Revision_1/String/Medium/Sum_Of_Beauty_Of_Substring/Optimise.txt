1)Loop through all substrings of the string.
2)Maintain a frequency map of characters for each substring.
3)For each substring:
4)Find the most frequent character's count.
--Find the least frequent non-zero character's count.
--Calculate the difference between the two counts.
--Add the difference to the running sum.

Outer loop: O(n) (for each starting index)
Inner loop: O(n) (for each ending index)
Computing max and min for frequencies: O(26) in the worst case (since only lowercase letters), O(n^2 * 26) ≈ O(n^2) because 26 is constant.

Space Complexity:
Frequency map uses at most 26 characters → O(26) = O(1).
No extra data structures apart from that.
