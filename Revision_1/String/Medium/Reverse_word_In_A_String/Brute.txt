1)Start by scanning the string to identify words, treating each word as a group of characters separated by spaces.
2)Store these words in a list, making sure to skip any extra or multiple spaces.
3)After collecting all the words, reverse the order of the list.
4)Join the reversed words using a single space between them.
5)Ensure the final result has no leading or trailing spaces.
