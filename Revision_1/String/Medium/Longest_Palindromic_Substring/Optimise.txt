1)The goal is to find the longest palindromic substring by treating each character (and each pair) as a potential center.
2)Every palindrome is symmetric, so we expand outward from a center to check for symmetry.
3)There are two types of centers to consider: one at a character (odd-length) and one between characters (even-length).
4)For each center, expand left and right while the characters on both sides match.
5)Keep track of the maximum length palindrome found by updating its start and end indices.
6)The final result is the substring between the recorded boundaries of the longest expansion.
7)TC: O(N^2)For each character, expanding could take up to O(N)
8)&& SC: O(1)
